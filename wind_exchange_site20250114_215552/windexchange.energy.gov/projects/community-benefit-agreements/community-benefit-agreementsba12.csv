Land-based wind energy project,Ocotillo,Imperial County,California,Fund,2012,Pattern Energy,112,265.0,,"- Ocotillo has committed $3 million dollars to address the region’s challenges, needs, and opportunities through three separate endowment funds; the funds have a core goal of improving the quality of life in Imperial Valley. The three funds – the Ocotillo Wind Community Fund, the Ocotillo Wind Education Fund, and the Ocotillo Wind Imperial Valley Fund – have all been established with initial gifts of $500,000 consisting of a $475,000 endowment and a $25,000 contribution earmarked for inaugural grant cycles. The remaining $1.5 million of Ocotillo's commitment will be gifted equally and annually to the Program’s funds, ensuring that for the next twenty years, there will be at least $25,000 for grant opportunities per year to support local organizations and causes from each fund. The Imperial Valley Community Foundation administers grant processes for the Ocotillo Wind Education Fund and Ocotillo Wind Imperial Valley Fund, whereas an advisory committee of Ocotillo and No Mirage residents guides the implementation of the Ocotillo Wind Community Fund.","https://patternenergy.com/projects/ocotillo-wind/, http://www.ivcommunityfoundation.org/funds-&-programs/ocotillo-wind-community-benefits-program/",2024-08-01 14:17:00 UTC,2024-08-01 14:17:00 UTC
